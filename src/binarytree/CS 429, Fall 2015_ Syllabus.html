<h3>Important Class Announcements:</h3>  

<b> Breaking news important to the class will be posted here.  Consult
this spot often.</b><p>

There will be no more weekly homeworks, even though there's a HW12 on
Canvas.</p><p>

The Test3 grades are now available on Canvas.  Here are the stats:
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs429/test-stats">Statistics</a>.</p><p>

You should have gotten a message re. the electronic course instructor
survey (eCIS).  If you'll fill it out and send me a screen shot
showing that you completed it, I'll give you 2 bonus points on the
final.  I do this every semester and tend to get much better
participation in the survey than many of my colleagues.  You'll have
a separate survey for your TA. Please fill out that one too, though
there's no bonus for that one.  BTW: I'm recording these, but won't
send an acknowledgment;  it's just too much trouble for 200 of you. </p><p>

Interesting article from IEEE:

The description for lab5 is here:
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs429/www.cs.utexas.edu/~cong/cachelab-handout.tar">Lab 5</a>.
 It's due on 11/30.  Don't expect an extension because the TAs need
 time to grade it. However, you can use slip days if you have any
 left. </p><p>

The final exam schedule is as follows.  For the 12:30 class:
Wednesday, December 9 from 7-10pm in Art 1.102. For the 3:30 class:
Friday, December 11 from 9am-noon in Wel 3.502.  You are expected to
take the exam with your class unless you clear it with me in
advance.</p><p>

<!-- It's come to my attention that some of you have turned off the
notifications for Piazza.  That's a very bad idea.  Piazza is one of
the official channels through which we communicate with you.  I know
that they volume of traffic can be annoying, but it's important and
keeps you connected with what's happening in the class.<P>

There will not be a homework for the week of Test3 / Thanksgiving.<P> -->

Dr. Young's office is in the south wing.  You have to take the south

<h3>Course Description:</h3> CS429 is the first course in the systems
core sequence required of all UT CS majors.  It describes how
computers operate at a fairly low level of abstraction.  
For example, we'll consider:
<ul>
<li> What are the components of a computer and how do they fit together?
</li><li> How do computers do arithmetic?
</li><li> How does the code you write actually execute?
</li><li> How does a program in a high level language like C get translated
  into a form the machine can execute?
</li><li> How can you write code likely to execute efficiently?
</li><li> How is information stored and accessed?
</li><li> How does your program access existing "libraries"?
</li></ul>
<i>Understanding these fundamentals thoroughly is absolutely essential
to your future success in computer science.</i>  The material of this
course is quite detailed and requires careful and diligent study. If
you are not willing to put in the time and effort required to master
this material, you probably should reconsider your decision to major
in Computer Science.<p>

In this class, you will be asked to complete some very challenging
assignments.  In some cases you will be expected to use tools and
techniques that are not discussed in class.  That is not to say that
help is not available; just that we expect you to be proactive about
learning.  This is a skill you must acquire now, because you'll need
it for your entire academic and professional career.  Toto, I don't
think we're in high school anymore!</p><p>

The students that do well in this class are survivors. This class is a
lot of work, and it is important to keep current. The material in this
class is cumulative; it can be quite difficult to catch up if one
falls behind. It is important to keep turning in homework and come to
class.</p><p>

We will be discussion several different programming languages in this
course: C, x86 assembly language, and Y86 assembly language.  You will
be writing programs in at least C and Y86. </p><p>

Students are required to attend their assigned lab weekly. <i>Note
      that the two Friday 9am sections are meeting together in Welch,
      not in the rooms originally scheduled.</i><br><br>

<!--  Restricted to computer science majors. An introduction to low-level
 computer design ranging from the basics of digital design to the
 hardware/software interface for application programs. Includes basic
 systems principles of pipelining and caching, and requires writing
 and understanding programs at multiple levels. Only one of the
 following may be counted: Computer Science 310, 310H, 429, 429H. -->

<b>Using Piazza:</b> We will be using Piazza for class
communication. The Piazza system is highly catered to getting you help
fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than
emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your
questions on Piazza. <b>If you turn off the notifications and miss an
important posting, you are responsible.</b> If you have any problems
or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.  The Piazza
class page will be posted shortly.  <i>Because of some issues in past
semester, posts may be anonymous to the class, but not to me.  I
expect that posts will be pertinent and respectful.  Don't use Piazza
as a place to vent or trash anyone.</i></p><p>

<!--

</p><h3>Prerequisites:</h3> You are expected to have taken and passed the
following courses (or equivalent) with a grade of at least C-:
Computer Science 311, 311H, 313H, or 313K; Computer Science 314, 314H,
315, or 315H.  If you don't have the prerequisites, be sure to clear
it with the CS department or risk being dropped from the class.<p>

</p><h3>Text:</h3> The required text book for this class is <i>Computer
Systems, A Programmer's Perspective</i> by Randal E. Bryant and David
O'Hallaron, Prentice Hall, 2016 (Third Edition).  <i>This semester
we're moving to the 3rd edition, which is substantially different from
the 2nd edition.</i> You must have this book.  Note that this book is
also used in CS439, so <i>don't sell it back at the end of the
semester</i> if you plan on continuing in CS.<p>

Since we will be programming some in C, I recommend that you have
access to <i>The C Programming Language</i>, second edition, by Brian
Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, Prentice Hall Software Series.  This is
available on-line.  There are also many Web pages devoted to
C-language programming.  A nice tutorial intro to C is here: 
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs429/C_tutorial.pdf">C Tutorial</a>.  Java programmers should have
no problem with the subset of C that we will use.</p><p>

</p><h3>Class Schedule and Slides:</h3>
The class schedule is here: 
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs429/429schedule.pdf">schedule</a>.
<i>This schedule is approximate; some dates may change.  Rely on the
  assignment handouts, not on this schedule for assignment due
  dates.</i><p>

All of the class slides will be made available via links below as we
cover new material.  You are welcome to print them out or view them
on-line.  Slides are in PDF form.  They are derived from slides
developed for the course by Bryant and O'Hallaron and modified by me

</p><h3>Tests:</h3> There will be three in-class exams of approximately
one and one half hour each. See the schedule for dates.  There will be
no makeups on in-class exams, but I will drop the lowest of these
three scores.  
The final exam schedule is as follows.  For the 12:30 class:
Wednesday, December 9 from 7-10pm in Art 1.102. For the 3:30 class:
Friday, December 11 from 9am-noon in Wel 3.502.  You are expected to
take the exam with your class unless you clear it with me in
advance.
<!-- The final exam will be at the time and place posted by
the registrar for a class in our time slot.  That appears to be
Wednesday, December 9 from 7-10pm for the 12:30pm class, and Friday,
December 11 from 9am to noon for the 3:30pm class. (Because ours are
unusual class durations, I'm not positive those times are right, but
they probably are.) -->
<!-- It appears that it will be Friday, December 12,
from 9am-noon, but since ours is a two hour class and the registrar's
site isn't clear, I'm not certain of that.   -->
Don't make travel plans that will conflict with these.<p>

</p><h3>Assignments:</h3> Written homework will be assigned each week.  It
must be submitted on Canvas and will not be accepted late.  You may
work together on written assignments.  This is an easy 15% of your
grade so make the most of it.<p>

You will have around 5-6 labs over the course of the semester.  <i>You
must work alone on all labs.</i>  The due dates will be clearly
marked.  For labs, you will have 3 total grace days available which
you can use over the course of the semester.  You'd be advised to save
them as long as possible to deal with illnesses and personal
emergencies. </p><p>

</p><h3>Attendance:</h3> You are strongly encouraged to come to class.
Attendance will not be checked, but my experience indicates that
students who regularly miss class do poorly.<p>

</p><h3>Computation of Your Grade:</h3>
The weighting of the grades for the various aspects of the course are
as follows: 
<br><br> 

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="5">
  <tbody><tr valight="top">
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><i>Component</i></td>
    <td bgcolor="cornflowerblue"><i>Percent</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> <th align="Left">In class exams (one dropped) </th><th>30%
  </th></tr><tr> <th align="left">Final Exam </th><th>20%
  </th></tr><tr> <th align="Left">Homework </th><th>15%
  </th></tr><tr> <th align="Left">Labs  </th><th>35%
</th></tr></tbody></table><br> 

It is very important that you do the laboratory assignments. Once a
laboratory has been turned in, material concerning a laboratory may
appear on an exam.<p>

Grades for the entire course tentatively will be averaged using the
weighting below:
<br><br> 

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="5">

This is tentative.  The grades likely will be curved and may be a bit
more generous than this.  They will certainly not be less
generous. That is, if you have a 90 you are guaranteed an A; but
somone who gets an 89 may also get an A, depending on the
final distribution of grades in the class.</p><p>

A course grade of at least C- is required for this course to count
toward a UT CS degree.</p><p>

</p><h3>Scholastic Dishonesty:</h3> Academic dishonesty will not be
tolerated.  See 
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct</a>
for an excellent summary of expectations of a student in a CS
class.<p>

All work must be the student's own effort.  <i>Work by students in
previous semesters is not your own effort.  Don't even think about
turning in such work as your own, or even using it as a basis for your
work.  We have very sophisticated tools to find such cheating and we
use them routinely.</i> It's far better to get a 0 on an assignment
than to cheat.</p><p>

No deviation from the standards of scholastic honesty or professional
integrity will be tolerated.  Scholastic dishonesty is a serious
violation of UT policy; and will likely result in an automatic F in
the course and may result in further penalties imposed by the
department or by the university.  <i>Don't do it!</i>  If you are
caught, you will regret it.  And even if you're not caught, you're
still a cheater.</p><p>

</p><h3>Students with Disabilities:</h3> 

Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259,
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd. <p>

</p><h3>Grad Students Clearing Architecture Background Requirement</h3>

If you're a grad student who needs to complete your background
requirement in Architecture by exam, I'm happy to help you with that.
You can do as little as take the final exam for CS429 with a grade of
at least 80%.  But be aware that the exams for this class (or any
class) are idiosyncratic and assume that the person taking the test is
also taking the class.  For example, there are questions about x86
syntax and calling conventions.  You could be a world-class expert on
MIPS or ARM architecture and not do well on the exam.  My suggestions
is to study the appropriate sections of the Bryant and O'Hallaron
book, review the class slides, and take the three in-class exams.
Otherwise, you risk not resolving your background deficit.<p>
